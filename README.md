## About this repo

In my research and engineering work, I usually need the "raw" implementations of some ciphers, such as AES, to verify my ideas. I used to find them on public repositories, however, those implementations do not exactly what I need in most of the cases.

To save time I store the implementations that suit me the best in this repo so that I can reuse them whenever I need.

## Ciphers

### Python

- [x] AES128
- [ ] PRESENT

### C
 
- [ ] AES128
- [ ] PRESENT

## :warning: Security Warning

The implementations in this repo are just "raw" implementations and should not be used in products.
